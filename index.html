Hey! This is how we're redoing the homepage as.. well.. the demo shouldn't really be the homepage.
Generally, it should be [MK] who is doing the works here; though, others are welcome to assist if they have the knowledge to do so.

        <h2>What is OnBoard?</h2>
        <p>
          OnBoard is a grade management program developed by five students as a substitute for other grade management
          solutions that were ineffective, slow, and completely disruptive to a student's learning process.
        </p>
      </span>
      <span class="row">
        <h2>Why should I choose OnBoard?</h2>
        <p>
          Since its creation, over 92% of <em>western</em> Pennsylvania has chosen OnBoard to be their <b>better grade manager</b>.
          We hope to further expand our outreach and eventually be used by 100% of Pennsylvanian school districtsâ€”maybe even the whole U.S.!

      <span class="row">
        <h2>What does OnBoard have that could be greater than our current solution?</h2>
        <p>
          OnBoard has many features that make our program greater than the rest, such as Google Workspace incorporation, flexible homework passes,
          teacher-regulated student group chats, and so many more! We hope you choose OnBoard to further our goals
