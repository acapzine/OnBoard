      <h3>Your Better Grade Manager</h3>

    <div class="content-row">
      <span class="content-row 1">
        <h3>What is OnBoard?</h3>
        <p>
          OnBoard is a grade and assignment manager, similar to Google Classroom and Skyward. OnBoard rises above the competition by showing scores in a quick and easy-to-understand layout.
        </p>
      </span>
      <span class="content-row 2">
        <h3>How much does OnBoard cost?</h3>
        <p>OnBoard is a paid program, meaning that your school <em>must</em> pay for the program for you to use it.</p>
        <h4>Rates</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Premium Class</b> - $750 per month | $25 API keys</li>
          <li><b>Platinum Class</b> - $500 per month | $50 API keys</li>
          <li><b>Gold Class</b> - $450 per month | $60 API keys</li>
        </ol>
      </span>
      <span class="content-row 3">
        <h3>What makes OnBoard better than the rest?</h3>
        <p>Although using features similar to Skyward and other grade management solutions, OnBoard expands on these by including stuff like our Instant Message System, which utilizes AI to filter messages and pictures; our homework pass, which allows teachers to set certain assignments able to use a homework pass (which is tailored to that teacher); or our grade calculator, which allows students to calculate how badly their grade would suffer if they were to get a bad score on something.</p>

      <div style="width: 33.3%; float: left;" class="A">
        <h3>Why should we choose OnBoard?</h3>
        <p>
          You should choose OnBoard because not only does <em>75%</em> of western Pennsylvania utilize our solution, but we have several API in different languages to make your own Kiosks for exporting class data and the Data Recognition Corporation (DRC; DRC Insight) has trusted us to incorporate their tests into our program.
