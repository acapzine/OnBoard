Hey! This is how we're redoing the homepage as.. well.. the demo shouldn't really be the homepage.
Generally, it should be [MK] who is doing the works here; though, others are welcome to assist if they have the knowledge to do so.

        <h2>What is OnBoard?</h2>
        <p>OnBoard is a grade management program developed by five students as a substitute for other grade management solutions that were inneffective, slow, and completely disruptive to a student's learning process.</p>
      </span>
      <span class="row">
        <h2>Why should I choose OnBoard?</h2>
        <p>Since its creation, over 92% of <em>western</em> Pennsylvania has chosen OnBoard to be their <b>better grade manager</b>. We hope to further expand our outreach and eventually be used by 100% of Pennsylvanian school districtsâ€”maybe even the whole U.S.!</p>
      </span>
      <span class="row">
        <h2>What does OnBoard have that could be greater than our current solution?</h2>
        <p>OnBoard has many features that make our program greater than the rest, such as Google Workspace incorporation, flexible homework passes, teacher-regulated student group chats, and so many more! We hope you choose OnBoard to further our goals</p>
